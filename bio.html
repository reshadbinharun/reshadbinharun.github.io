		<p> Reshad is a simple man with simple needs and wants. Starting at the early age of 5 years, he hunted for food and gathered nuts for his entire village. Needless to say, the women of his village were very fond of Reshad. One day, Reshad decided that as the alpha-male of the village community, Reshad, His Excellency, could not go on without a suitable mate. What would his society think of him? What would his elders say? He therefore, in his infinite wisdom, decided to host the first ever Hunger Games to find the perfect mate. </p>
